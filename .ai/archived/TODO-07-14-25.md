# Completed Features

## ai features
- [x] should be able to copy content from code blocks in ai chat view
- [x] ai chat messages should have a context menu popover with option to copy
  content

## general usage
- [x] ui/ux for pages
  - [x] create new page
  - [x] history sidebar already has pages sorted by most recently modified
  - [x] only one path for page (instead of page vs daily note, bc they're all 
    pages)
- [x] should be able to edit referenced blocks on a page
- [x] should be able to add reference blocks on a page to chat context
- [x] cmd + space like mac spotlight to search for pages and blocks
- [x] ability to collapse/expand blocks with nested children
- [x] refactor the data models
  - instead of having a Page, Block, Tag, could we just have Page and Block, and
    to support "tags", we would allow a Block to belong to many Pages. a "tag"
    would mean a block belongs to that Page and the frontend would render and
    parse the information as "tags" visually.
- [x] blocks should have a context menu popover. right now a cool option would
  be to move to current day
  - could move delete here? kinda makes it annoying to delete lots of blocks
- [x] clicking dark or light option in settings should toggle the mode
  immediately so the user can see the change
- [x] better use of space on mobile
  - [x] daily note view 
  - [x] ai chat 
- [x] ability to reorder blocks. drag n drop would be great, but maybe just an 
  "editing view" w/ up/down arrow would be sufficient for now

# Completed Cleanup Tasks

- [x] remove empty __init__.py files that are not needed
- [x] python imports should not be done inside methods, they should be imported
  at the top of the file
- [x] backend forms that have a field that describes a related model should use
  the `ModelChoiceField` instead of `CharField`. you can still pass the pk when
  creating the form and it will find the correct model instance, you don't have
  to pass the entire model instance. the arg to ModelChoiceField should be
  something like `queryset=SomeRepository.get_queryset()`. A good example is
  UpdateBlockForm.
  ```python
  class UpdateBlockForm(BaseForm):
    user = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=UserRepository.get_queryset())
    block_id = forms.CharField(required=True)
  ```
  The `user` field is defined correctly, but the `block_id` field needs to be
  changed to
  `block = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=BlockRepository.get_queryset())`. We
  need to fix this issue for all forms in our app
- [x] core commands's constructors should only take forms, not other args
- [x] not all view functions follow conventions. there is a fair amount of
  business logic in ai_chat view files
- [x] knowledge views dont use response types

# Completed Bug Fixes

- [x] currently we can only move undone blocks to current day, but the option is there when
  viewing any daily note. create a MoveUndoneTodosForm that has a `user` field
  and an optional field named `target_date`, with no default value. Next, you 
  need to refactor MoveUndoneTodosCommand to use this form, and then update the
  command logic to handle the `target_date` field. If the field is not provided,
  it should default to the current date. If it is provided, it should move the
  undone blocks to that date instead of the current date.
