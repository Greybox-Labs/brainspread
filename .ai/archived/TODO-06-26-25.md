# Completed Bug Fixes

- [x] tags not created when block created, maybe when block is updated too
- [x] is the management command to create a test user necessary?
- [x] the auto save feature on the front end moves selection away from the input
  so it suddenly stops user input and is annoying
- [x] shows login page between page clicks even when logged in
- [x] hitting "enter" creates a new block at the bottom, but if you are focused
  on not-the-last block, it should create the next block underneath the current
  block
- [x] hitting "enter" now creates a block under the current block, but only at
  the top level. if you are in a nested block and hit enter, it should create a
  new block as a next immediate sibling of the current nested block
