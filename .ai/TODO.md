# Features

- [ ] should be able to drag and move block ordering and nestings around
- [ ] ui/ux for pages
- [ ] reminders/notifications? kinda useless without push notifications which
  require a mobile app i think?
  - maybe can use something like Pusher? i still think you need APN details for
    that
  - maybe can use Twilio? though Sam did say recently that you have to jump
    through some hoops to get a phone number now
- [ ] when a user submits a web link, it should be accessed and summarized with
  tags auto-generated from the content
- [ ] when a user submits a web link use semantic search to find similar blocks
  and pages and show them in sidebar
- [ ] blocks should have a context menu popover. right now a cool option would
  be to move to current day
- [ ] clicking dark or light option in settings should toggle the mode
  immediately so the user can see the change

# Questions

- [ ] Filebase storage vs database? filebase storage could
  be more portable and easier to handle media. hm we'd
  still want some form of metadata for the objects. maybe
  a metadata file with the same name or something? how tenable
  to update if the filename is changed? will the filename be changed?
  how often?

# Bugs

- [ ] hitting "enter" to create a new block when on a note from a previous day,
  it incorrectly creates a new block for the current day instead of under the
  active block
- [ ] when hitting tab on a new block, it indents the block properly, but it
  does not keep focus on the block
- [ ] can't see nested blocks for past daily notes in list view

# Maybe later

- [ ] implement sentence-transformer and chromadb
