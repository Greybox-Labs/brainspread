# Questions
- [ ] Filebase storage vs database? filebase storage could
      be more portable and easier to handle media. hm we'd
      still want some form of metadata for the objects. maybe
      a metadata file with the same name or something? how tenable
      to update if the filename is changed? will the filename be changed?
      how often?
