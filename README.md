# Brainspread

A local-first personal data aggregation and AI-powered knowledge management system.

## Problem

We generate massive amounts of digital data daily - web history, Spotify plays, YouTube videos, chats, todo lists, notes. Most of it is tracked but scattered across different platforms. There's not much you can do with this data beyond what each company provides in isolation.

## Solution

Brainspread is a local-first text and blob database with importers/syncers for many different apps and media types, augmented with an AI feature builder. It replaces the collection of note taking apps, bash scripts, one-off apps, plugins, and manual workflows with a unified research assistant and idea surfacer.

Key features:
- **Local-first**: Your data stays on your machine
- **Universal importers**: Web history, media consumption, notes, chats, etc.
- **Auto-zettelkastening**: Automatic linking and connections between imported data
- **AI-powered feature builder**: Create custom applets and plugins
- **Research assistant**: Surface ideas and connections across your data

## MVP Scope

The initial MVP focuses on:
- Simple notes app with rich text editing
- Web history importer and analyzer
- Automatic zettelkastening (linking) of imported data
- AI-powered feature/applet/plugin builder

## Development Setup
